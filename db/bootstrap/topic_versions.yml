Horowhenua Library Trust are responsible for the creation and ongoing development of the site.</p><p>Kete aims to get privately owned papers and photographs out from under beds and sitting alongside public archive and photograph collections. But we want so much more too. We want to capture the memories and stories that are our heritage, we want a place where our artists can showcase their work, and where our businesses and attractions can promote themselves, where we can celebrate who we are and how we live and what we do through photographs, video and audio footage and stories.</p><p>What we want is a vibrant and lively community of Kete users adding value to the site: joining together related photographs and clips and documents by writing and submitting an article or story; a story that others can add their own memories and knowledge to as well.</p><p>Kete was developed with Ruby on Rails, utilizes Zebra z39.50 full text indexing engine developed by IndexData, is fully compatible with Koha, and will be released under a&nbsp; <a href=\"http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html\" title=\"GNU General Public License (GPL)\">GNU General Public License (GPL)</a>. The Kete software is available for download and we invite other communities to build their own Kete.</p><p>This Horowhenua Library Trust project is carried out in partnership with Horowhenua District Council and Levin SeniorNet, and was funded from the National Digital Strategy : Community Partnership Fund.</p><p>You can read more about Kete and what we&#39;re trying to do at <a href=\"http://blog.kete.net.nz\" title=\"The Kete blog\">http://blog.kete.net.nz</a></p><p><a href=\"http://blog.kete.net.nz\" title=\"The Kete blog\"></a></p><h3>The future</h3> <p>Our aim is to bring Kete to the world! We are seeking funding to do the following:</p>  <p>1. Build a release of the code (minus all the Horowhenua customizations) that can be downloaded, installed and configured using a web based wizard to step newbies through the process, thus allowing a unique Kete installation.</p>  <p>2. Develop a prototype for skins or themes to allow a  customized installation reflecting an organisations culture or style.</p>  <p>3.  Establish a kete.net community site for developers and users.</p> <p>&nbsp; If you interested in helping with further development (especially with cash!) then please contact us.<br /> <br /> </p> <h3>Who&#39;s involved in Kete?</h3><p><span style=\"font-weight: bold\">Conception: </span>Kete was the bright idea of Joann Ransom, Deputy head of Libraries, Horowhenua Library Trust and Kete Project Manager.<span style=\"font-weight: bold\"><br /> </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: bold\">Partners:</span> Horowhenua Library Trust have partnered with Horowhenua District Council and Levin SeniorNet for this project.</p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: bold\">Funders:</span> The National Digital Strategy : Community Partnerships Fund provided the bulk of the development funding, supplemented by Horowhenua Library Trust, Horowhenua District Growers Association and Horowhenua District Council. Ross McColl Cars have provided us with transport whenever we have needed it, and Horowhenua College with a computer suite</p><p><span style=\"font-weight: bold\">Developers:</span> Walter McGinnis (Lead Developer), Russell Garlick (Information Architect) Robert Lyon (Web Programmer), and the rest of the crew at <a href=\"http://www.katipo.co.nz\">Katipo Communications</a>.</p><p><span style=\"font-weight: bold\">Content Manager: </span>Pippa Coard has worked full time for nine months coordinating the collection of content, and managing volunteers.</p><p><span style=\"font-weight: bold\">Workers:</span> We asked for help and boy did we get! We have had thousands of hours of voluntary labour gifted to us by individuals in the community preparing digital content.</p><p><span style=\"font-weight: bold\">Community groups:</span> Horowhenua and Foxton historical societies have provided the bulk of the seed collection, and Lorraine and Chris Wright from the Levin branch of NZ Society of Genealogists have created databases for bulk import.</p> \t\t</div> \t\t<div class=\"cleaner\">&nbsp;</div> \t</div><!--  /container --> \t<div class=\"cleaner\">&nbsp;</div>"

You should read the <a href=\"/about/terms.html\">Terms and Conditions</a> and <a href=\"/about/privacy.html\">Privacy Policy</a> before you register.</p> <p>Once you start the registration process by clicking on <span style=\"font-weight: bold\">Register</span> you will need to work fairly steadily to enter the required information. If you find you have troubles with the security code at the end it is because it expired while you were filling out the information; no problem - but you will have to start again! </p><p>You will need to enter the following information:</p></div></div>   <ul> <li><span style=\"font-weight: bold\">Login</span>: this is your private login name and will not be seen by other Kete users. It must be unique and we will check that it is available for use and let you know if it is isn&#39;t. It must not contain any spaces or punctuation, and is case sensitive so be careful about capitals and lower case letters. Choose something you will remember easily.<br />     <p style=\"font-style: italic\">If your name is John Smith your login might be &#39;jsmith17&#39;.</p>     </li><li><span style=\"font-weight: bold\">Email:</span> enter your email address. We will send you a confirmation email message when you have registered.     <br /> <br />   </li> <li><span style=\"font-weight: bold\">Password</span>: choose a secret password that only you know or could guess easily. A good password would be 6 - 8 characters long and include a mixture of letters and numbers. We can not see your password so you might want to write it down somewhere safe, or maybe just a hint to help you remember it. <br />     <br /> </li><li><span style=\"font-weight: bold\">User name</span>: This is screen name that other users will know you by. It could be your real name, especially if you want people to be able to find you, but it could also be a nickname. It can contain spaces and capitals.<br />     <br />     <span style=\"font-style: italic\"> If your name is John Smith you might select &#39;John Smith&#39; as your user name or you might prefer &quot;Captain Courageous&quot;.&nbsp;</span> <br /> <br /> </li><li><span style=\"font-weight: bold\">Email visible?</span> You will be asked whether you want other Kete users to be able to see your email address.&nbsp; This can be helpful if you are interested in the same Kete subject areas, or if they are interested in some of the material you have added to kete. It is set to no by default.<br />     <br /> </li><li><span style=\"font-weight: bold\">Interests</span>: You may like to list your interests or research areas for other Kete users. This is optional, but will be particularly helpful for genealogists and researchers.<br />     <br /> </li><li><span style=\"font-weight: bold\">Security Code</span>: You will need to type in the security code that is shown in a greyed out box. This is case sensitive so capitals and lower case are important. This lets us know you are a person and not a potentially destructive, automated process. It changes after a short time period so you need be quite fast filling out your form. If you have taken too long and the security code check fails, then you need start again.<br /> </li>  </ul>  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You will need to acknowledge that you have read and accept to abide by the <a href=\"/about/terms.html\">Terms and Conditions</a> , <a href=\"/about/privacy.html\">Privacy Policy</a> and <a href=\"/about/rules.html\">House Rules</a> by clicking on the small check box to the left.</p> <p>Once you are registered you will be able to participate fully in every aspect of the Kete website.</p>  <table border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"20\" cellpadding=\"20\" align=\"center\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"background-color: #d6e5c1\"><a href=\"/about/topics/show/3\">Registration</a>&nbsp;</td><td style=\"background-color: #d6e5c1\"><a href=\"/help/topics/show/7\">Finding things</a>&nbsp;</td><td style=\"background-color: #d6e5c1\">&nbsp;<a href=\"/help/topics/show/8\">Adding things</a></td></tr><tr><td style=\"background-color: #d6e5c1\">&nbsp;<a href=\"/help/topics/show/9\">Linking things</a><br /></td><td style=\"background-color: #d6e5c1\">&nbsp;<a href=\"/help/topics/show/10\">Fixing things</a></td><td style=\"background-color: #d6e5c1\">Text editor<br /></td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td style=\"background-color: #d6e5c1\">&nbsp;<a href=\"/help/topics/show/11\">Locked baskets</a><br /></td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table><div id=\"static-left\">&nbsp;</div>"

  description: "<h3><font face=\"arial,helvetica,sans-serif\">Introduction</font></h3><p><font face=\"arial,helvetica,sans-serif\">There are a number of different ways to find material in this kete database. You can find things by discovery, or you can search for specific material.</font></p><p><font face=\"arial,helvetica,sans-serif\">The homepage provides these ways to discover material:&nbsp;</font></p> <ul><li><font face=\"arial,helvetica,sans-serif\">browse</font></li><li><font face=\"arial,helvetica,sans-serif\">featured topics</font></li><li><font face=\"arial,helvetica,sans-serif\">contents by type</font></li><li><font face=\"arial,helvetica,sans-serif\">slideshow</font></li><li><font face=\"arial,helvetica,sans-serif\">latest 5 topics</font></li></ul><p><font face=\"arial,helvetica,sans-serif\">You can also find material by</font></p><ul><li><font face=\"arial,helvetica,sans-serif\">keyword search</font></li><li><font face=\"arial,helvetica,sans-serif\">following hyperlinks</font></li></ul><p>Hyperlinks are bits of highlighted and underlined text, or they could be an image that cause the cursor to change to a hand when you move your cursor over it.&nbsp; Every page will have a number of hyperlinks and they are the way to move around this kete database.&nbsp;  </p><br /><h3><font face=\"arial,helvetica,sans-serif\">Browse</font></h3> <p><font face=\"arial,helvetica,sans-serif\">By clicking on the browse button from the menu in the top right hand corner of the screen, you can see the entire contents of the database, with each item type displaying on a seperate tab. To view images only, click on the second tab , video clips on the 4th tab etc. <br /></font></p><p><font face=\"arial,helvetica,sans-serif\">You can vary how many records display per page by clicking on 5, 10, 20 or 50 records per page, from the menu at the bottom right of the screen. This makes it a pretty quick task to scan a few hundred items in a few minutes.<br /></font></p> <p><font face=\"arial,helvetica,sans-serif\">Browsing is a really easy way to track of new additions to the database; the lists are sorted with the newest or edited ones displaying first.</font></p><p>&nbsp;</p>  <h3><font face=\"arial,helvetica,sans-serif\"><strong>Featured Topics</strong></font></h3> <p><font face=\"arial,helvetica,sans-serif\">These are a selection of topics selected as being of particular interest. They might be new, or interesting, or demonstrate a really exciting use of the Kete Text editor (more on this later!). You can view the featured topic by clicking on the image or the title. Once you are at the topic page you can dig deeper by clicking on any of the links on the page.<br /></font>  </p> <br /><h3><font face=\"arial,helvetica,sans-serif\"><strong>Contents by Type<br /></strong></font></h3>   <p><font face=\"arial,helvetica,sans-serif\">The contents of the Kete database are listed here, sorted by item type. It is just another way of browsing really, just showing on the homepage. Just click on an item type link.&nbsp;</font>  </p>  <br /><h3><font face=\"arial,helvetica,sans-serif\"><strong>Slideshow</strong></font></h3>   <p><font face=\"arial,helvetica,sans-serif\">The sidebar has a continuous slideshow of random images from the database. They change every 20 seconds but if one catches your eye you can click on the image to go to the detailed screen. You can advance through to the next image by clicking on next.</font></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><font face=\"arial,helvetica,sans-serif\"><strong>Latest 5 Topics<br /> </strong></font></h3>    <p><font face=\"arial,helvetica,sans-serif\">The newest 5 topics to be added to the Kete database display on the bottom left portion of the homepage. Jusxt click on the hotlinked title to go to the full record.</font></p><p>&nbsp;</p>   <h3><font face=\"arial,helvetica,sans-serif\">Keyword Searching</font></h3><h3><font face=\"arial,helvetica,sans-serif\"><strong> </strong></font></h3> <p><font face=\"arial,helvetica,sans-serif\">Kete is searched by typing a few words in the keyword search box; 1 - 3 words are usually enough. To the search the whole database make sure you do this from the homepage search box, or after clicking o the search link from the top right menu.</font></p> <p><font face=\"arial,helvetica,sans-serif\">You can <strong>truncate</strong> a word if you are not of the spelling or want to include variants on a word; for instance you could enter &quot;peters&quot; if you are now sure whether a name is spelt &#39;Petersen&#39; or &#39;Peterson&#39;.<br /><br />Kete will accept simple <strong>boolean operators</strong>. This means you can search on a phrase if you place it between quote marks. For example a search on&nbsp; &quot;Horowhenua College&quot; will only produce results that contain those 2 words together in a phrase, and leave out all the records containing both of these words but not sitting beside each other eg &auml; Topic containing: &quot;Waiopehu is a college in Horowhenua&quot;. You can also use&nbsp; <strong>and</strong>&nbsp; and <strong>or</strong>&nbsp; and&nbsp; <strong>not</strong> to join phrases together. <br /></font> </p> <p><font face=\"arial,helvetica,sans-serif\">Kete uses fuzzy searching. This means that if you misspell a word it will try and find something close. For instance a search on &#39;polo&#39; will also bring up results for &#39;pole&#39; because we only had 1 result for &#39;polo&#39; and you may have meant &#39;pole&#39;.<br /></font>  </p>       <font face=\"arial,helvetica,sans-serif\"><strong><br /></strong></font><h3><font face=\"arial,helvetica,sans-serif\"><strong>View Search Results</strong></font></h3>     <p><font face=\"arial,helvetica,sans-serif\">Search results are sorted by item or file type, with each item type on its own &#39;tab&#39;. Tabs in kete work like tabbed divider pages in a ringbinder, separating items into different catageories</font></p><ul><li><font face=\"arial,helvetica,sans-serif\">images or photographs</font></li><li><font face=\"arial,helvetica,sans-serif\">audio clips</font></li><li><font face=\"arial,helvetica,sans-serif\">video clips</font></li><li><font face=\"arial,helvetica,sans-serif\">weblinks or urls</font></li><li><font face=\"arial,helvetica,sans-serif\">documents</font></li><li><font face=\"arial,helvetica,sans-serif\">discussion comments</font><br /></li></ul>    <p><font face=\"arial,helvetica,sans-serif\">To view the results, click on the tab of the item type you want to look at. The number on the tab shows how many records there are of each type. </font></p><p><font face=\"arial,helvetica,sans-serif\">Each item type will display a list of results which matched your search terms. To view a particular record, click on anything which is a hyperlink. Clicking on a hyperlink will take you to the full record of the particular item.<br /></font> </p>  <p><font face=\"arial,helvetica,sans-serif\">By default, the search results display 5 records per page. To view the next &#39;page&#39; click on the <strong>next</strong> link on the right hand side of the screen (about 1/2 way down). You can also use the <strong>previous</strong> link to move backwards and forwards.<br /></font> </p><p><font face=\"arial,helvetica,sans-serif\"> You can change the number of records that display per page by selecting a 10, 20 or 50 from the menu at the bottom right hand corner of the screen.</font></p> <table border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"20\" cellpadding=\"20\" align=\"center\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"background-color: #d6e5c1\"><a href=\"/about/topics/show/3\">Registration</a>&nbsp;</td><td style=\"background-color: #d6e5c1\"><a href=\"/help/topics/show/7\">Finding things</a>&nbsp;</td><td style=\"background-color: #d6e5c1\">&nbsp;<a href=\"/help/topics/show/8\">Adding things</a></td></tr><tr><td style=\"background-color: #d6e5c1\">&nbsp;<a href=\"/help/topics/show/9\">Linking things</a><br /></td><td style=\"background-color: #d6e5c1\">&nbsp;<a href=\"/help/topics/show/10\">Fixing things</a></td><td style=\"background-color: #d6e5c1\">Text editor<br /></td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td style=\"background-color: #d6e5c1\">&nbsp;<a href=\"/help/topics/show/11\">Locked baskets</a><br /></td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table><div id=\"static-left\">&nbsp;</div>"

  description: "<h3>Introduction</h3><p><strong>Items</strong> are individual records in Kete. They can be a variety of different types: </p><ul><li>Images</li><li>Audio recordings</li><li>Video recordings</li><li>Documents</li><li>Web links</li><li>Discussion<br /></li></ul> <p><strong>Topics</strong> are the way to gather items together into subject clusters of related material, regardless of item type. </p><div id=\"static-left\"><h3>&nbsp;</h3><h3>Add a New Topic</h3><div id=\"static-left\"> Topics are gathering points for drawing clusters of items together and a way to capture and craft the collective knowledge of our community. <br /> <br /> A Topic is like an encyclopedia article; it can be anything from a few sentences to a few pages long. The difference is, that Kete Topics are built collaboratively by the Kete community. One person might write the Topic, but other people can add to and edit the Topic. <a href=\"http://www.wikipedia.com\">Wikipedia</a>&nbsp; is a good example of collectively written articles. <br /> <br /> If you would like to know if someone changes a Topic you have written you can subscribe for an RSS feed. <br /> <br /> Topics are used to gather together related items. An item may be linked to from one topic, many topics or none at all. In the early days of Kete there will be many thousands of items and very few topics. We need people to write topics and then link them to related images, documents, web links, audio and video items. <br /> <br /> <br /> Select <span style=\"font-weight: bold\">Add a new Topic</span> from the bottom of the search result  or browse page.<br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-weight: bold\">Choose a topic type</span> first. A range of Topic templates have been built based on different sorts of topics. These are arranged in a heirachy from the most general to more specific. After the highest level topic, there are 5 parent topics, and a number of subtopics attached to these. Subtopics inherit the fields of their parent topic.<br /> </div><div id=\"static-left\">&nbsp;</div><div id=\"static-left\">&nbsp;</div><div id=\"static-left\">&nbsp;</div><div id=\"static-left\"><table border=\"0\" width=\"625\" height=\"396\"><tbody><tr><td colspan=\"32\" style=\"border: 1px solid #000000; background-color: #99cc99\">General&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /></td><td style=\"border: 1px solid #000000\">&nbsp;Highest level, and most general topic</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"32\" style=\"background-color: #99cccc\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Person</td><td style=\"border: 1px solid #000000\">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"32\" style=\"border: 1px solid #000000; background-color: #99ccff\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Artist <br /></td><td style=\"border: 1px solid #000000\">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"32\" style=\"border: 1px solid #000000; background-color: #99ccff\">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Genealogy</td><td style=\"border: 1px solid #000000\">&nbsp;This contains many fields about a persons parents, spouse and children.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"32\" style=\"border: 1px solid #000000; background-color: #99ccff\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Serviceman</td><td style=\"border: 1px solid #000000\">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"32\" style=\"border: 1px solid #000000; background-color: #99cccc\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Place</td><td style=\"border: 1px solid #000000\">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"32\" style=\"border: 1px solid #000000; background-color: #99cccc\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Event</td><td style=\"border: 1px solid #000000\">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"32\" style=\"border: 1px solid #000000; background-color: #99cccc\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Structure</td><td style=\"border: 1px solid #000000\">&nbsp;For example this could be a monument, building or bridge</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"32\" style=\"border: 1px solid #000000; background-color: #99cccc\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Organisation</td><td style=\"border: 1px solid #000000\">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"32\" style=\"border: 1px solid #000000; background-color: #99ccff\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; School </td><td style=\"border: 1px solid #000000\">&nbsp;Use this for educational institution from preschool to University. </td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"32\" style=\"border: 1px solid #000000; background-color: #99cccc\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Collection <br /></td><td style=\"border: 1px solid #000000\">&nbsp;Use this to group together a collection of records gathered by 1 person or organisation, but which may not be related by subject . </td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"32\" style=\"border: 1px solid #000000; background-color: #99cccc\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Publication</td><td style=\"border: 1px solid #000000\">&nbsp;Make a publication topic for the title, author etc, then attach each chapter or page as a related document.</td></tr></tbody></table>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  </div><div id=\"static-left\"><p>Once you have selected a topic and clicked on the choose button, a from will appear for you to fill in. Most fields are optional, with only the first 2 being compulsory:</p>  </div><ul><li><span style=\"font-weight: bold\">Title</span> : A few words.     </li><li><span style=\"font-weight: bold\">Short summary</span>: a sentence summarising or introducing the topic.<br />     </li><li><span style=\"font-weight: bold\">Description</span>: this field can be as long as you like and is the body of the topic. You can use the Kete Text Editor tools to format your text if you like, with bolding, highlighting or italics. You can insert tables, weblinks or images<br /></li><li><span style=\"font-weight: bold\">Tags</span> : Tags are keywords which are used to search Kete. You don&#39;t need to enter words already used in the title, summary or description. Enter as many as you like, separated by a comma. Think about who the people are, what the subject matter is, what the items or objects or places are. When was the photo taken? The more tags you enter here the more chance we have of other people finding it! This field is optional <br />   </li></ul> Some templates contain many fields eg. People - genealogy. Just fill out as many fields as you have information for. When you have finished select <span style=\"font-weight: bold\">Create</span> and the topic you have just created will display on screen. You are now ready to add related items to this topic if you have some, or link to related items or related topics already in the database. <br /> <br /><br /> <h3>Link to a Related Existing Topic</h3><p>Once you have written your Topic you can link it to existing Topics and Items, forming webs of related material. A<span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif\">t the bottom of each Topic page, you will find&nbsp; <span style=\"font-weight: bold\">+Link to related topic</span></span></p> <p>Click on this and a pop up window will appear with a search box. Enter a keyword or two and a list of Topics that match your search will appear. Select them by clicking on the white box to the left. As each one is linked it will disappear from the list and be replaced with the message &quot;<span style=\"font-weight: bold\">Topic Linked Succesfully</span>&quot;. When you have finished close the window.</p><p> If you are unsure whether a Topic is related or not you can go to the Topic detail page by clicking on the Topics title, and the Topic will open in a separate window. Close the window when you are finished by clicking the red cross in the top right corner.</p><h3>Protecting your Topic From Changes&nbsp;</h3><div id=\"static-left\">A primary aim of kete is that the database is collaboratively built. This means you can edit other people work and they can edit yours.</div><div id=\"static-left\">&nbsp;</div><div id=\"static-left\">Sometimes though, you may want your work to stay as you wrote it, and not be available for editing. To do this you can save it as a pdf and attach it as a document item. Just enter a summary into the description field, rather than the full text, and put lots of useful tags to help people find your work. You could also write a really brief Topic using the publication template and link it to your document, especially if your work comprises many pages. Put each section up as a separate document and link to them from the topic.</div><div id=\"static-left\">&nbsp;</div><div id=\"static-left\">If you intend to add a large amount of material to Kete, you could inquire about a Locked Basket by contacting the Site Administrator at the contact link on the homepage.<br /></div><div id=\"static-left\">&nbsp;</div><h3>&nbsp;</h3><h3>Add a new Item</h3>  <h2> </h2>     <p class=\"MsoNormal\">Adding any of the different Item type all happen with broadly the same process, although they each have slightly different onscreen forms to fill in: <br /> </p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\">1. Select the item type you want to add:<br /> </p> <ul><li>Images</li><li>Topic</li><li>Documents</li><li>Audio</li><li>Weblinks.</li></ul> <p class=\"MsoNormal\">Go to the right tab, depending on your choice above, from either the search or browse screens. At the bottom of the screen you will find a link: <strong>&Auml;dd a new Image</strong>&nbsp; (or audio or document etc). Click on it and a template will open for you to complete. &nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">2. Fill out the 3&nbsp; fields:<br /> </p> <ul><li>Title</li><li>Short Summary</li><li>Description<br />   </li></ul> <p class=\"MsoNormal\">3. Browse to the file you want to upload, which must be prescanned and available . Any common file format can be loaded.</p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\">4. Complete the optional fields if can.<br /> </p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\">5.&nbsp; Click on the Create button.<br /> </p> <h4><br /> </h4> <h4>Images</h4> <p>Images can be digital photographs, digital copies of photographs or digital photographs of objects or things. Any common file format can be used; jpegs for preference. Tiffs will work but they won&#39;t generate a thumbnail image in the search results. It is best not to load up large files; 200dpi is fine for internet&nbsp; display. Remember that many people have slow broadband or dialup connections.<br /> </p> <h4> </h4>    <h4><br /> </h4> <h4>Topic</h4> <span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif\">Topics can be linked or related to other Topics. eg. father to son, or a Family to a sub division of their farm etc. <br /> </span><br /> <h4>Weblinks</h4> <p class=\"MsoNormal\">Sometimes the copyright statement of something you found on the internet forbids you from copying or saving the information. In this case you can add a weblink in Kete which will link back to the place on the internet. You will need to add the url of the web resource, instead of browsing for a file. The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Url\">url</a> is displayed in the address bar and usually starts with http://www. Instead of copying this long&nbsp; piece of information down you can copy and paste. Copy by right click on your mouse then selecting copy, or cntrl C. To paste it in either right click - paste or Cntrl V.</p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\">The only problem with links is the internet changes all the time, and links which worked last month may not work next month. If you can legally copy the content off into a topic or description thats definitely the best way, but often you can&#39;t and a weblink will have to do. <br /> </p> <h4>Documents</h4> <p class=\"MsoNormal\">You can attach most common file types as documents. We have found that compressed jpegs download much faster than normal jpegs. Remember that some people still have dial up connections so make your files smaller if possible.<br /> </p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\">The documents can be a scan of the original document eg a letter or a page from&nbsp; a minute book. The contents of the document will not be searchable by Kete, but there are a couple of ways to help people find your document:<br /> </p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold\">Title</span>: Write a short, specific title.<br /> <span style=\"font-weight: bold\">Short summary</span>: A few sentences summarising the contents of the document. This will display on the search results list.<br /> <span style=\"font-weight: bold\">Description</span>: This can be a complete transcript of the document if you wish, or someone else might do this for you.<br /> <span style=\"font-weight: bold\">Tags</span>: enter lots of keywords.<br /> </p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\">If you want to write your description first, please use a text editor, like Notepad, rather than Word or Word Pad. If you copy and paste from a Word document&nbsp; into the Description field lots of nasty formatting comes over which you can&#39;t see but which&nbsp; can cause havok with the display.&nbsp; Copying from Notepad works fine. You will find it&nbsp; on a Windows system under start, programmes, accessories. Don&#39;t do any formatting except paragraphs, because it will all be lost when you paste it into Kete - but you can format it in once you are there ie bold, underline, italics etc.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Documents are a great way to manage large works. Scan each small section, as in a few&nbsp; pages, and add each section as a separate document. Big pdfs are awful to download.&nbsp; &nbsp;  Gather them all together by linking them to a Publication topic. <br /> </p> <h4>Video</h4> <div>You need to save your video clip as a simgle file, not a folder with an audio and video file. We have successfully uploaded .mpg ,&nbsp; .avi&nbsp; and&nbsp; .wmv  video. </div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>.swf should be supported, as should macromedia director files. We recommend Quicktime as the best current format.&nbsp; It&#39;s well developed and stable. Microsoft have tried many times to come up with a professional level video format and for various reasons they end up back at the drawing board, thus a large amount of earlier windows formats that Microsoft abandons support for after a while.</div> &nbsp;   <h3>Add a related existing Item</h3>  <p>Kete has been seeded with about 10,000 images from the collections of Foxton and Horowhenua Historical Societies, plus many hundreds of pages of typed material our volunteers have prepared. These can be linked to Topics.</p><p>At the bottom of each Topic page, for each Item type, you will find&nbsp; <span style=\"font-weight: bold\">+Link image </span>(or documents, audio, video, web link).</p> <p>Click on this and a pop up window will appear with a search box. Enter a keyword and a list of Images that match your search will appear. Select them clicking on the white box to the left. As each one is linked it will disappear from the list and be replaced with the message &quot;<span style=\"font-weight: bold\">Image Linked Succesfully</span>&quot;. When you have finished close the window.</p><div id=\"static-left\"><br /><h3> Tags</h3></div><div id=\"static-left\">    &#39;Tags&#39; or keywords are entered by the creator, and by anyone else who thinks other words should be included. Tags are hyperlinks so you can search for other items in Kete by clicking on a tag. Any variations of useful search terms can be added as a tag.<br /> <br />  </div><h3>Discussion</h3>    You may have something to say about a topic or item; maybe you think it contains errors but you are not sure, or you want to add an informal comment or recollection. You can add a comment to the discussion by clicking the <span style=\"font-weight: bold\">Add a Comment</span>&nbsp; hyperlink.<br /> <br /> <br /></div> <table border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"20\" cellpadding=\"20\" align=\"center\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"background-color: #d6e5c1\"><a href=\"/about/topics/show/3\">Registration</a>&nbsp;</td><td style=\"background-color: #d6e5c1\"><a href=\"/help/topics/show/7\">Finding things</a>&nbsp;</td><td style=\"background-color: #d6e5c1\">&nbsp;<a href=\"/help/topics/show/8\">Adding things</a></td></tr><tr><td style=\"background-color: #d6e5c1\">&nbsp;<a href=\"/help/topics/show/9\">Linking things</a><br /></td><td style=\"background-color: #d6e5c1\">&nbsp;<a href=\"/help/topics/show/10\">Fixing things</a></td><td style=\"background-color: #d6e5c1\">Text editor<br /></td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td style=\"background-color: #d6e5c1\">&nbsp;<a href=\"/help/topics/show/11\">Locked baskets</a><br /></td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table><div id=\"static-left\">&nbsp;</div>"

  description: "<h2>Introduction&nbsp;</h2><p>Locked baskets are fully searchable with a general Kete search, but a search can be limited to a specific basket. While locked baskets can be searched by anyone, the contents can only be edited by the basket owner and nominated members. </p><h4>How do I get one?</h4><p>Locked baskets are rare, and are given to organisations who intend to build large or unique collections within Kete. If you are interested in a Locked basket please contact the Site Administrator a the contact link on the homepage.</p><h2>Set Up<br /></h2>    <p>Locked baskets are essentially mini-ketes and are configured by the basket administrator. Each locked basket has a homepage which is similar in structure to the main Kete. There are a number of components to be considered and configured:</p>      <ul><li>Main portion</li><li>Search</li><li>Contents</li><li>Slideshow</li><li>Tagcloud</li><li>Latest 5 topics</li></ul>              <h3><strong>Access the configuration tools </strong></h3>          <p>Following a successful application you will need to configure your Locked Basket. At the bottom of the main Kete homepage you will see a list of featured baskets. Click on your basket, and you will see 3 options appear: edit, members, delete. Select edit to configure your basket.</p>    <h3>&nbsp;</h3><h3>Edit</h3>    <p>Selecting Edit will take you to the configuration page.</p>    <h4>&nbsp;1.

A current homepage topic will have been created for you in skeleton form. You will need to edit it by clicking on the link. It is edited like any other Topic in Kete.</p><p>Later, you may want to create a replacement homepage topic over a couple of sessions, rather than editing the existing one. Click on a <font color=\"#0000ff\">Add new</font> to do this, and when you have finished and are ready to make it your homepage topic click on <font color=\"#0000ff\">Link to new</font> and enter the title of the replacement homepage Topic.

  description: "<h3>The Dream<br /></h3><p>I would love every community in New Zealand to have a Kete they can contribute theirs stories to. I would love these Kete to be part of a nationwide Kete.net system, whereby searchers can select which Kete to search on. Imagine if you knew your family hailed from the West Coast gold fields, but then farmed at Foxton, and how with one search you could select to run your search over Kete Kapiti and Kete West Coast, and the results would all appear in one list.</p><p>This is possible with Kete, it is possible with New Zealand, and It is possible anywhere else in the world you cared to set up a Kete network.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>What we have done so far</h3> <p>&nbsp;We have just about got this Kete where we want it; still a small handful of bugs to fix but all core functionality and proof of concept work is done now. We seriously underestimated our development budget for Kete (being a bunch of wildly optimistic Kiwi&rsquo;s) and have been finishing the product off with voluntary labour and no budget.&nbsp;</p><p> The Library Trust has taken a huge financial hit getting Kete this far - because they love it - but we&rsquo;ll need help to get it out to the world.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>What next&nbsp;</h3><p>The next  step is getting the code ready to release - and for this we will have to pay the  developer!</p> <p>We propose to do the following:</p> <p>1. Build a release of the code (minus all the Horowhenua customizations) that can be downloaded, installed and configured using a web based wizard to step newbies through the process, thus allowing a unique Kete installation.</p> <p>2. Develop a prototype for skins or themes to allow a  customized installation reflecting an organisations culture or style.</p> <p>3.  Establishing a kete.net community site for developers and users.</p> <p>4. Pay a Kete.net coordinator to promote, advise, guide and develop the project.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>How much&nbsp;</h3><p>We need another $NZ 100k for the next round of development work. This will achieve 1-3 above. Then we need about $30k a year.</p> <p>We have an application in to our original funders, NZ National Digital Strategy : Community Partnership Fund, for a second chunk of cash to make Kete available for all who want it, and we should hear back late June. We have also applied to Te Paerangi National Services at Te Papa for some help.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>How to help&nbsp;</h3><ul><li>You can make personal or institutional donations by credit card from anywhere using the Paypal donation onthe Kete homepage; even just $20 from many people will get us where we need to be.</li><li>If you want a Kete for your community, no matter where you are in the world, then you may need to consider helping us out financially so we can get the code ready and a support community established.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Contacts</h3><p>Jo Ransom from <a href=\"http://library.org.nz\">Horowhenua Library Trust</a> about the project itself, and to use Kete. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; email: jransom@library.org.nz</p><p>Walter McGinnis from <a href=\"http://www.katipo.co.nz\">Katipo Communications</a> about the technical stuff.</p><p>Rachel Hamilton-Williams at <a href=\"http://www.katipo.co.nz\">Katipo Communications</a> about getting your own Kete.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This site is based on the Kete software.  Kete is a knowledge basket of topics, images, audio, video, web links, documents, and discussion which are collected and catalogued by the community.</p>
    <p>You have successfully installed and configured Kete. This is a good time to further customise it to suit your needs.</p>
    <p>Kete has lots of options which may seem daunting when you get started.  Don't worry, you can customise a little or a lot.  You can also easily change things later.  Feel free to change your Kete incrementally.</p>
    <h3>Edit Included "About" and "Help" to Suit Your New Site</h3>
    <p>You will want to immediately review and edit the <a href="/about/topics/edit/4" onclick="window.open(this.href,'links','height=600,width=740,scrollbars=yes,top=100,left=100,resizable=yes');return false;">Terms and Conditions</a> to fit your site.  The included topic is just a starting point, please edit it to suit your needs.  This is what users will have to agree to when registering.</p>
    <p>The <a href="/about/" onclick="window.open(this.href,'links','height=600,width=740,scrollbars=yes,top=100,left=100,resizable=yes');return false;">About basket</a>, in Kete terms a section of the site is called a basket, is meant to contain a description of your site and its policies.  It comes with starter topics for both.  We recommend that you give these a quick edit to reflect your needs.</p>
    <p>The <a href="/help/" onclick="window.open(this.href,'links','height=600,width=740,scrollbars=yes,top=100,left=100,resizable=yes');return false;">Help basket</a> is for your user manual.  It certainly can't hurt to familiarise yourself with these and adjust where appropriate.</p>
    <p>The default topics were originally written by <a href="http://horowhenua.kete.net.nz/">Kete Horowhenua</a>.  We owe them a great big thank you for them.</p>
    <h3>The Administrator's Toolbox</h3>
    <p>Not surprisingly, the Adminstrator's Toolbox at the bottom of each page will appear if you are logged in as a site administrator.  Here you will find links to add a new area of the site (add basket), add or edit fields that may appear in forms of topics or content items (extended fields), manage users of the site (site members), and setting up the various topic types and content types to use the extended fields that you have.</p>
    <p>In addition, if you are also a technical administrator, you gain the ability to run imports or manage which search databases (Z39.50 search databases) are used.</p>
    <p>The Administrator's Toolbox is where to start if you want to manage your Kete later.</p>
    <h3>Extended Fields, Topic Types, and Content Types</h3>
    <p>Your Kete will contain Items and Topics. All items and topics can have extended fields attached. For topics, it is possible to build a Topic Type template for shaping content by nominating various fields to be used for that topic.</p>
    <h4>Extended Fields</h4>
    <p>Fields are used in Kete by Topics and Item types. In the current version of Kete they are used primarily for displaying metadata for a topic or field. As the system evolves and grows, the intent is to make fields more powerful through automatic linking, spawning searches and field ranking for searches. At the moment though, they are used primarily to make the topic and item pages easier to scan for information.</p>
    <p><br />Kete has a very flexible approach to fields. Where as in a library context, the use of certain fields is governed by MARC standards, Kete fields can be whatever is deemed to be appropriate to the content of the Kete. All fields can be mapped to a simple Dublin Core Metadata Element. Kete supports the Open Archive Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting. Once the fields are mapped to DCM Elements, Kete is a compliant OAI PMH repository. This means that OAI PMH harvesters (such as google) will be able to make better use of the data in your repository.</p>
    <p>Nominating Kete fields is not something that needs to be done completely at set up. As the repository grows, it is expected that the administrator will add more fields as required to meet the needs of the data set. The catch is that if new fields are added to the repository once a significant amount of data is added, then older records will need to be updated.</p>
    <h4>Field parameters in Kete</h4>
    <p><strong>Label</strong><br />This is the field name. It is what will display to all users. <br />For items this will display under the item on the item page. For topics the fields are displayed (by default) to the right in the highlight box. <br />Examples: Creator, Place of Birth</p>
    <p><br /><strong>Description</strong><br />The description displays to the administrator only on the field edit screens. These need to be meaningful to administrators only as they are not seen by the public. As such it can be left blank but is useful for keeping notes about the field if the name or use is ambiguous.</p>
    <p><br /><strong>XML Element</strong><br />This is where references to Dublin Core Metadata Terms are stored. At present Kete will recognize and utilize only the simple set of DC terms. The fields are currently free text but the terms should be prefixed with dc:. Acceptable terms are:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Title (this is automatically mapped to the title or name given for each item or topic)</li>
    <li>Creator - dc:creator</li>
    <li>Date - dc:date</li>
    <li>Subject - dc:subject</li>
    <li>Description - dc:description (this automatically mapped to the description text area for each item or topic)</li>
    <li>Publisher (mapped to your Kete name)</li>
    <li>Contributer dc:contributor (mapped to the Kete user)</li>
    <li>Type dc:type</li>
    <li>Format dc:format</li>
    <li>Identifier dc:identifier</li>
    <li>Source dc:source</li>
    <li>Language dc:language</li>
    <li>Relation dc:relation</li>
    <li>Coverage dc:coverage</li>
    <li>Rights dc:rights </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The most commonly mapped elements in the HLT Kete are dc:date, dc:subject and dc:coverage.</p>
    <p><br /><strong>Ftype (Field Type)</strong><br />Usually text or check box. E.g text. Field types is one area that Kete does require additional development. Currently most fields are setup as field type text. This means free data entry. It is hoped that once the community of users grow there will be resources made available so that developers can extend this functionality to include such things as nominating a date field (user input via a calendar interface) and configuring drop down list or radio button options.</p>
    <p><br /><strong>Import Synonym (Ignore)</strong><br />This is used for importing data sets into Kete from Past Perfect or CSV files. The import synonym is the column name in the file that matches with the Kete field.</p>
    <p><br /><strong>Example</strong><br />This is used to help shape the data in free text fields. The administrator can suggest the format the data can be saved in. This is suggestion is displayed in italics below the field label.</p>
    <p><br /><strong>Multiple</strong><br />Currently when 'multiple' is selected, instead of one text field being available for data entry, the user is presented with multiple input fields. The administrator can define how many multiple fields are displayed as part of the site settings.</p>
    <h4>Level of Detail Required</h4>
    <p>At this stage a full and definitive set of fields is not required. Fields can be added at any time. However it does make it easier later on if the fields are thought through at this stage. Particularly fields that will be used by multiple topics and items.</p>
    <p><br />Working on fields can not be done in isolation from determining initial Topic Templates and Item Types. The initial Topic Templates you decide to build will influence the fields you require. Our advice is to think carefully about the fields you will nominate. To few, and the data will not be useful, too many and it will be onerous and clumsy to add new information to your Kete.</p>
    <h4>Topics</h4>
    <p><strong>Summary </strong><br />Topics are used to link items together. They provide the user browsing a Kete with the background information as to why various and seemingly, unrelated items, are in fact related. Topics can also be linked to other topics.</p>
    <p><br />The minimum set of data that can be stored against a topic is a Title, a Short Summary (used in search results) and the Description. To enable further content shaping, topic templates can be created where fields can be associated to a topic. These templates can be built into a hierarchy, where each child template, inherits the fields form it&rsquo;s parent template, and extends with it&rsquo;s own fields.</p>
    <p>Topics are not essential for a Kete to work. A Kete can have just items. The purpose of topics is to make it easier for other users to find content within Kete. <br /></p>
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
    <h3>The Site Basket</h3> <p>Homepage options apply to both the homepage of the Kete (ie the root) and basket homepages. All can be configured to a have different layouts.</p>
    <h4>Name</h4>
    <p>This will be used in all links and to create the link to the basket homepage <br />e.g Title Adopt An Anzac, URL http://horowhenua.kete.net.nz/adopt_an_anzac</p>
    <h4>Home page Redirect</h4>
    <p>Instead of a homepage, the basket URL can be redirected to other content in Kete. <br />The options are:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>No Redirect (default - this will create a homepage using the homepage options)</li>
    <li>Search results for this basket of </li>
    <ul>
    <li>All topics</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
    <li>All images</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
    <li>All audio</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
    <li>All video</li>
    </ul>
    <li>All documents</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
    <li>All web links</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
    <li>All discussion</li>
    </ul>
    <li>No Redirect Options</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If No Redirect is chosen there are two more options for what is displayed on the homepage</p>
    <p><br />Either</p>
    <ul>
    <li>The homepage topic only or;</li>
    <li>The homepage topic, full details (extended fields) and comments</li>
    <li>The homepage topic, and full details (extended fields)</li>
    <li>The homepage topic, and comments</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Recent Topics Options</h4>
    <p>The basket home page can be configured to included different types of displays for topics recently added to the basket.</p>
    <p><br /><strong>Number of Recent Topics to display</strong><br />This is a free text integer. Recommended values are 3, 5 and 7.</p>
    <p><br /><strong>Display options</strong><br />There are 3 display options:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Don't display recent topics (default)</li>
    <li>Summaries (blog style). Displays Title and Short Summary for topic. </li>
    <li>Headlines (news style). Displays Title and Description (main body content) for topic.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Side bar Options</h4>
    <p>The next set of options are all for configuring the sidebar. The sidebar position, size and style are controlled by CSS. This interface does not allow the editing of these parameters, only what displays in the side bar. The order of these elements can not be changed and the order they are displayed is as per the order here.</p>
    <p><br /><strong>Search</strong><br />Checking this box will include a search box for this basket in the side bar. This search is restricted to the contents of the basket only. Items within a basket will show up on a standard Kete search, but from this interface, only topics and items within this basket will be returned.</p>
    <p><br /><strong>Content in Sidebar </strong><br />Any content entered into the HTML editor will be displayed in the side bar for the home page. This can include images, tables and links. However javascript or forms can note be embedded.To enter no content, leave the editor blank. </p>
    <p><strong>Selected Image</strong><br />Displays a thumbnail image from the basket. Clicking on the thumbnail links to the image details. <br />There are 3 options:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>No image (default)</li>
    <li>Latest </li>
    <li>Random. If random is selected, this will generate a slide show of images from the basket. </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Archives</strong><br />Two options</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Don't display (default)</li>
    <li>By type. This provides a link to the search results for each Item type and gives a count of the number of items in the search results</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For example:</p>
    <ul>
    <li> Topics (1,200)</li>
    <li> Images (10,839)</li>
    <li> Audio (66)</li>
    <li> Videos (8)</li>
    <li> Web Links (88)</li>
    <li> Documents (652)</li>
    <li> Discussion (10)</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Tags</strong><br />This displays tags used within the basket. The tags are links to search results of items that use those tags. There are several sub options.</p>
    <p><br /><strong>Number of Tags</strong><br />This sets the number of tags to be displayed and is a free text integer.</p>
    <p><br /><strong>Tag Display</strong><br />Two options:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>As categories - in a list form </li>
    <li>As a tag cloud - where size and boldness of text indicates size of collection<br /></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>This Topic (Site Homepage)</h3>
    <p>Lastly you will want to edit this topic using the edit link below.  You can also replace it, either with another topic or by redirecting users to results for all topics, images, audio, video, web links, documents, or discussion via the site basket edit page.</p>

The initial Topic Templates you decide to build will influence the fields you require. Our advice is to think carefully about the fields you will nominate. To few, and the data will not be useful, too many and it will be onerous and clumsy to add new information to your Kete.</p>
    <h4>Topics</h4>
    <p><strong>Summary </strong><br />Topics are used to link items together. They provide the user browsing a Kete with the background information as to why various and seemingly, unrelated items, are in fact related. Topics can also be linked to other topics.</p>
    <p><br />The minimum set of data that can be stored against a topic is a Title, a Short Summary (used in search results) and the Description. To enable further content shaping, topic templates can be created where fields can be associated to a topic. These templates can be built into a hierarchy, where each child template, inherits the fields form it&rsquo;s parent template, and extends with it&rsquo;s own fields.</p>
    <p>Topics are not essential for a Kete to work. A Kete can have just items. The purpose of topics is to make it easier for other users to find content within Kete. <br /></p>
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
    <h3>The Site Basket</h3> <p>Homepage options apply to both the homepage of the Kete (ie the root) and basket homepages. All can be configured to a have different layouts.</p>
    <h4>Name</h4>
    <p>This will be used in all links and to create the link to the basket homepage <br />e.g Title Adopt An Anzac, URL http://horowhenua.kete.net.nz/adopt_an_anzac</p>
    <h4>Home page Redirect</h4>
    <p>Instead of a homepage, the basket URL can be redirected to other content in Kete. <br />The options are:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>No Redirect (default - this will create a homepage using the homepage options)</li>
    <li>Search results for this basket of </li>
    <ul>
    <li>All topics</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
    <li>All images</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
    <li>All audio</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
    <li>All video</li>
    </ul>
    <li>All documents</li>
    </ul>

    </ul>
    <h4>Recent Topics Options</h4>
    <p>The basket home page can be configured to included different types of displays for topics recently added to the basket.</p>

    </ul>
    <h4>Side bar Options</h4>
    <p>The next set of options are all for configuring the sidebar. The sidebar position, size and style are controlled by CSS. This interface does not allow the editing of these parameters, only what displays in the side bar. The order of these elements can not be changed and the order they are displayed is as per the order here.</p>
    <p><br /><strong>Search</strong><br />Checking this box will include a search box for this basket in the side bar. This search is restricted to the contents of the basket only. Items within a basket will show up on a standard Kete search, but from this interface, only topics and items within this basket will be returned.</p>
    <p><br /><strong>Content in Sidebar </strong><br />Any content entered into the HTML editor will be displayed in the side bar for the home page. This can include images, tables and links. However javascript or forms can note be embedded.To enter no content, leave the editor blank. </p>
    <p><strong>Selected Image</strong><br />Displays a thumbnail image from the basket. Clicking on the thumbnail links to the image details. <br />There are 3 options:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>No image (default)</li>

    </ul>
    <p><strong>Archives</strong><br />Two options</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Don't display (default)</li>
    <li>By type. This provides a link to the search results for each Item type and gives a count of the number of items in the search results</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For example:</p>
    <ul>
    <li> Topics (1,200)</li>
    <li> Images (10,839)</li>
    <li> Audio (66)</li>

    <li> Web Links (88)</li>
    <li> Documents (652)</li>
    <li> Discussion (10)</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Tags</strong><br />This displays tags used within the basket. The tags are links to search results of items that use those tags. There are several sub options.</p>
    <p><br /><strong>Number of Tags</strong><br />This sets the number of tags to be displayed and is a free text integer.</p>
    <p><br /><strong>Tag Display</strong><br />Two options:</p>
