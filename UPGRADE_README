The following steps are only necessary if you continuously upgrade your code base to the latest Kete trunk.
Occasionally there are additional minor steps needed to update your Kete installation between revisions.
You can find these by scrolling down to the time where you last updated Kete, and going up through the additional steps.

GENERAL NOTE: If you have a lot of things to do, you could alternatively follow the upgrade guide mentioned above, which is
essentially a collection of all the commands used below into one step by step guide.

GENERAL NOTE: It is assumed you are upgrading from an earlier functional and unmodified trunk version. If not, be sure to preserve
the customizations you want to keep when you upgrade the code base.

GENERAL NOTE: Quite often you'll only have to do steps once to get the changes from multiple revisions.  In other words,
if a step is listed from multiple revisions, you only have to do it once.

IMPORTANT NOTE: For any steps where you run, "rake db:migrate", it is a good idea to back up your database before you run that step.

GENERAL NOTE: if you are upgrading your production Kete instance rather than development, you'll add "RAILS_ENV=production" to all rake tasks.

GENERAL NOTE: if you are running in production mode, you may also want to do a "rake tmp:cache:clear" as your last step to any of these.
However, if you updated your code via a Capistrano deploy, this is probably not necessary.

== 2008/08/07 - Fixing Caching Issues

1.      Stop your Kete server (mongrels, backgroundrb).
2.      Upgrade your code base
3.      rake tmp:cache:clear (not necessary for capistrano deployments)
4.      Start your Kete server again (mongrels, backgroundrb)

== 2008/08/01 - Making search for contributions by a user be limited to login, rather than non-unique user name

1.      Stop your Kete server (mongrels).
2.      Upgrade your code base
3.      Start your Kete server again (mongrels)
4.      Rebuild your search records (see other tasks below for summary under "Use the web interface to repopulate your Zebra database...")

== 2008/08/01 - Adding system setting for Syntax Highlighting support

1.      Stop your Kete server (mongrels).
2.      Upgrade your code base
4.      Run the upgrade script: 'rake kete:upgrade'
5.      Start your Kete server again (mongrels)

== 2008/07/18 - Upgrading backgroundrb and packet gem

1.      Upgrade your code base
2.      Down/Upgrade to packet 0.1.7 (the next version is buggy). You can skip this step if you already have packet 0.1.7 installed.
          $ gem uninstall packet --all
          $ gem install packet --version 0.1.7
3.      Edit config/backgroundrb.yml and update it to match the structure of config/backgroundrb.yml.example. Point the :memcached: section to the appropriate IP of the memcached server (default should usually suffice).
4.      Run the database migration 'rake db:migrate'
5.      Restart your Kete instance (mongrels)
6.      Restart your Backgroundrb instance:
          ./script/backgroundrb stop
          ./script/backgroundrb start

1.      Upgrade your code base
2.      Run the database migration 'rake db:migrate'
3.      Restart your Kete instance (mongrels)
